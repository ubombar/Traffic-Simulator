# Traffic Simulator
Traffic Simulator is a software, capable of simulating traffic and living conditions in a small city. Project is planned to take real road data from [United states census Bureau](https://github.com/ubombar/Traffic-Simulator.git). This dataset concsists of road files for counties. Additionally; specification of office, living and parking spaces are required for application to perform high quality simulations. Details can be founded in the documents folder.

## Reports
* [Analysis Report](/documents/AnalysisReport.pdf): Presents a system proposal with functional/nonfunctional requirements. Expresses system models along with high level diagrams.

* (*not implemented yet*) [Design Report](/documents/DesignReport.pdf): Presents the software architecture, subsystems and low level design.

* (*not implemented yet*) [User Report](/documents/UserReport.pdf): Presents the software architecture, subsystems and low level design.

## Documentation
Usage of the system will be documented along with the development proess. [User Report](/documents/UserReport.pdf) should provide an overview and description on usage for users.
